# Day 1 – Prompting (Kaggle 5-Day GenAI Intensive)

Welcome to **Day 1** of the Kaggle *5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course* by Google. 
This notebook captures your learning, experiments, and hands-on work around foundational large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering.

## 📘 What’s Covered

- Introduction to LLMs: Understanding how foundational models like Gemini work.  
- Getting started with the Gemini API using the `google-genai` Python SDK.  
- Prompt engineering basics: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.  
- Sampling parameter tuning: adjusting temperature, top-k, top-p to control model behavior.  
- Writing structured prompts for more predictable and useful outputs.

## 🧪 Why This Matters

Prompt engineering is the “interface” between you and the LLM:

- It influences how the model thinks, reasons, and responds.  
- Good prompts can reduce errors, improve relevance, and make the AI more helpful.  
- Understanding sampling parameters (like temperature) helps balance creativity and precision.  

These are foundational skills for building production-ready generative AI applications.

## 🚀 Notebook Structure

1. **Setup**  
   - Installing the `google-genai` SDK  
   - Setting up the API key via Kaggle secrets  
   - Initializing the Gemini client  

2. **First Prompt**  
   - A simple test prompt to confirm the API is working  
   - Displaying model response  

3. **Prompt Engineering Techniques**  
   - Zero-shot prompt examples  
   - Few-shot prompt examples  
   - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning examples  

4. **Tuning Sampling Parameters**  
   - Varying `temperature` to see changes in output randomness  
   - Using `top_k` and `top_p` for controlling diversity  

5. **Structured Output / JSON Mode**  
   - Designing prompts that make the model output data in a structured JSON format  
   - Using schemas or templates for predictable responses  

6. **Best Practices & Tips**  
   - How to write clear instructions  
   - When to use system-level prompts  
   - Strategies for iterative prompt refinement  

## ✅ Key Learnings / Takeaways

By the end of this notebook, you should:

- Be comfortable calling the Gemini API via Python.  
- Know how to craft different kinds of prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT).  
- Understand how sampling parameters influence model outputs.  
- Be able to design prompts that return structured data (e.g., JSON).  
- Appreciate the importance of prompt clarity and iterative experimentation.

## 🚧 Notes / Known Issues

- If running on Kaggle, make sure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correctly set in **Kaggle Secrets**.  
- Be aware of API rate limits — you may hit `429 Too Many Requests` errors if you call too frequently.  
- For streaming responses, wrap your calls in retry logic to handle transient API errors (e.g., rate limiting or server issues).

**Enjoy Day 1!**  
Feel free to fork this repository, add your own experiments, and iterate on prompts. 
Mastering prompting now will pay off in later days when building agents, grounding with retrieval, or deploying GenAI applications.
